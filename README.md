Homework 1: Code Refactor

-Objectives for the assignment : We are given a base code (index.html) along with its linked style sheet and our goal is to successfully change the HTML tags in the documents in order to add semantic meaning when relevant.

-Within this repository you will find my corrected index.html file with semantic tags added as well as a linked stylesheet that is also corrected.

-The task is to change the non semantic tags to semantic tags to better understand the importance of organization and clarity when working collaboratively.
